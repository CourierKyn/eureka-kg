The technique was developed in the early 1990s.[7][8] Since it integrates both neural networks and fuzzy logic principles, it has potential to capture the benefits of both in a single framework. Its inference system corresponds to a set of fuzzy IF–THEN rules that have learning capability to approximate nonlinear functions.[9] Hence, ANFIS is considered to be a universal estimator.[10] For using the ANFIS in a more efficient and optimal way, one can use the best parameters obtained by genetic algorithm.[11][12]\n",

Because computers are often used to model not only other discrete systems but continuous systems as well, methods have been developed to represent real-world continuous systems as discrete systems. One such method involves sampling a continuous signal at discrete time intervals.\n",

An inference engine using forward chaining searches the inference rules until it finds one where the antecedent (If clause) is known to be true.

      "Intelligent personal assistant – A virtual assistant or intelligent personal assistant is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on verbal commands. Sometimes the term \"chatbot\" is used to refer to virtual assistants generally or specifically accessed by online chat (or in some cases online chat programs that are exclusively for entertainment purposes).  Some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. Users can ask their assistants questions, control home automation devices and media playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists, and calendars with verbal commands.

      "Interpretation (logic) – is an assignment of meaning to the symbols of a formal language. Many formal languages used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics.\n",

They also provide a reference point to see how each piece fits into the whole picture of a problem.[185]\n",

      "Junction tree algorithm – (also known as 'Clique Tree')  is a method used in machine learning to extract marginalization in general graphs.  In essence, it entails performing belief propagation on a modified graph called a junction tree. The graph is called a tree because it branches into different sections of data; nodes of variables are the branches.[186]\n",

      "Kernel method – In machine learning, kernel methods are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, whose best known member is the support vector machine (SVM). The general task of pattern analysis is to find and study general types of relations (for example clusters, rankings, principal components, correlations, classifications) in datasets. In its simplest form, the kernel trick means transforming data into another dimension that has a clear dividing margin between classes of data.[187]\n",

      "Asymmetric Cryptography (Public Key Cryptography): Asymmetric cryptography, is also known as public key cryptography. It uses public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data. The keys are large numbers that have been paired together but are not identical (asymmetric). A public key can be shared with everyone. The private key in the pair is kept secret. Protocols such as SSH, S/MIME rely on asymmetric cryptography for encyption and digital signature functions.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "4\n",
      "Blockchain: Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, comprised of unchangable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks (rather like collating them on to a single sheet of paper). Each block is then ‘chained’ to the next block, using a cryptographic signature. This allows block chains to be used like a ledger, which can be shared and accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "5\n",
      "Burning: Refers to the Proof of Burn consensus algorithm. Burning coins is the action of sending them to an address where they are irretrievable. As a miner, the more coins you burn, the better chance you have of being selected to mine the next block, thus earning more rewards.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "6\n",
      "Confirmation: Confirmation means that the blockchain transaction has been verified by the network. This happens through a process known as mining, in a proof-of-work system (e.g. Bitcoin). Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed or double spent (immutable). The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to perform a double spend attack.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "7\n",
      "Consensus Algorithm: A consensus algorithm ensures that the next block in a blockchain is the one and only version of the truth, and it keeps powerful adversaries from derailing the system and successfully forking the chain.The most widespread form of consensus algorithm is Bitcoin’s Proof of Work and involves contributing power in the form of computing capacity measured as hash rate. The most common alternative to POW of Proof of Stake. Other consensus algorithms include Proof of Activity, Proof of Burn, Proof of Capacity, Proof of Elapsed Time.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "8\n",
      "Cryptography: Cryptography is the encryption and decryption of data. There are two main cryptographic concepts used in Blockchain, Hashing and Digital Signatures. In general, there are three forms of encryption that are widely used, symmetric cryptography, asymmetric cryptography, and hashing.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "9\n",
      "dApp: A dApp is a decentralized application that must be completely open-source, it must operate autonomously, and with no entity controlling the majority of its tokens.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "10\n",
      "Decentralisation: Decentralisation means the network operates on a peer-to-peer basis. A global network of computers use blockchain technology to jointly manage the database that records transactions instead of one central server.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "11\n",
      "Design Goals: Design goals refer to the first step in the Blockchain 3 layer model. They are set of concepts or properties that you wish your smart contract to have. These include Distribution, Decentralization, Immutability and Peer to Peer.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "12\n",
      "Digital Signature: Digital Signatures are a way to prove that somebody is who they say they are. A digital signature is a way to prove that a message originates from a specific person and no one else. When you visit a website, you are using SSL. This uses a digital signature to establish trust between you and the service.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "13\n",
      "Disintermediation: The removal of middlemen. In Blockchain it refers to the removal of intermediaries from transactions. Examples of middlemen would be Visa and Mastercard.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",

      "Distributed ledgers: Distributed ledgers are a type of database that are spread across multiple sites, countries or institutions. Distributed ledger data can be either “permissioned” or “un-permissioned” to control who can view it.\n",

      "15\n",

      "Ethereum Test Network: To mitigate the risk of bugs in your smart contract on the main net it is important to test it before deploying to the Main Network. Ethereum has multiple test networks that you can set up as an acceptance environment. Ethereum Test networks include: Rinkeby, Ropsten and Kovan.\n",

      "EVM — Ethereum Virtual Machine: EVM is the Ethereum smart contracts byte-code execution environment. Every node in the network runs EVM. All the nodes execute all the transactions that point to smart contracts using EVM, so every node does the same calculations and stores the same values.\n",
